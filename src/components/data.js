    bio: "Hey everyone! My name is Nij, and I am a senior CS student here (with a minor in business!) at Pitt and this year's CSC president. I'm also a TA for a couple classees! I am super interested in the intersection of tech + business through software engineering. My freshman year I interned at Fidelity Investments and my sophomore  summer I interned at Prudential Financial. This summer, I am working at Appian. Outside of compsci, I love playing video games (I know real unique for a CS major), collecting sneakers, and watching Philly sports (forever salty about the Eagles, Phillies, and Sixers). I also enjoy tutoring at my local Kumon back home! Feel free to reach out or shoot me a message at any of the socials!"
